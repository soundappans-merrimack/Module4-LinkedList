# SortedLinkedList Program

## Overview
The `SortedLinkedList` program is a simple Java application that reads a list of integers from user input, stores them in a `LinkedList`, and sorts them in ascending order using Java's `Collections.sort()` method.

## Features
- Reads integers from the user interactively.
- Stores numbers dynamically using Java's `LinkedList`.
- Sorts the list using Java Collections Framework (`Collections.sort()`).
- Runs entirely from the command line without requiring an IDE.

## Usage

### Compilation
To compile the Java program, use the following command:
```sh
javac SortedLinkedList.java
### Sample Input & Output
